# CALL TO FAITH: COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION
## Eliminating Communication Barriers for Employment Success

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Call to Faith represents a revolutionary approach to employment barrier elimination for homeless individuals at Churches United. This program provides immediate smartphone access to qualified participants during their first week of shelter residence, creating unprecedented opportunities for job acquisition through 24/7 connectivity, digital literacy training, and integrated employment support tools. The program operates on a sophisticated assessment-based qualification system that ensures devices reach individuals genuinely committed to employment while preventing abuse through psychological evaluation, responsibility assessment, and progressive payment structures.

## PROGRAM OVERVIEW

### Core Mission
Call to Faith eliminates the fundamental communication barrier that prevents homeless individuals from accessing, applying for, and maintaining employment. By providing smartphones with comprehensive employment tools during the critical first week of shelter residence, the program transforms the traditional employment search timeline from months to days.

### Target Population
- Individuals experiencing homelessness who lack mobile communication capabilities
- Residents who have demonstrated work eligibility through proper documentation
- Participants who pass comprehensive psychological and responsibility assessments
- Those committed to genuine employment seeking rather than device acquisition

### Unique Program Features
- **Immediate Device Provision**: Qualified residents receive smartphones within 7 days of intake
- **Employment-First Design**: All features specifically optimize job search and employer communication
- **Graduated Payment Model**: Device costs begin only after employment acquisition
- **Transportation Integration**: Automatic qualification for Trinity Trikes (no license) or company truck (valid license) upon job offer
- **Continuous Access Model**: 24/7 availability of employment tools eliminates case manager dependency

## PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES

### **Advanced Truthfulness Detection Framework**

#### **Multi-Layered Verification System**

##### **Layer 1: Response Consistency Analysis**
**Methodology**: Identical questions presented in different formats throughout assessment
- **Primary Question**: "How many jobs have you held in the past 2 years?"
- **Verification Question**: "Describe your employment history since [specific date 2 years prior]"
- **Cross-Reference**: "What was your longest period of unemployment in recent years?"

**Scoring**: Inconsistencies in employment numbers, dates, or circumstances indicate potential dishonesty

##### **Layer 2: Social Desirability Bias Detection**
**Implementation**: Questions designed to identify respondents providing idealized rather than realistic answers

**Example Detection Questions**:
- "Have you ever called in sick when you weren't actually ill?" (Honest answer typically includes some instances)
- "Have you ever had a disagreement with a supervisor?" (Universal workplace experience)
- "Do you ever arrive exactly on time rather than early for appointments?" (Realistic acknowledgment of human behavior)

**Scoring**: Consistently perfect responses across all behavioral questions indicate potential dishonesty

##### **Layer 3: Situational Judgment Verification**
**Methodology**: Hypothetical workplace scenarios requiring honest rather than ideal responses

**Scenario Example**:
"You're scheduled to work at 8 AM but wake up at 7:55 AM. Your workplace is 20 minutes away. What do you do?"

**Truthfulness Indicators**:
- Honest acknowledgment of tardiness
- Realistic problem-solving approach
- Acceptance of consequences
- Contact with supervisor about delay

**Dishonesty Indicators**:
- Claims they would arrive on time
- Unrealistic solutions (running 20 minutes in 5 minutes)
- No acknowledgment of employer impact
- Blame external factors exclusively

##### **Layer 4: Temporal Verification Crosschecking**
**Implementation**: Employment history dates cross-referenced with:
- Government assistance receipt periods
- Incarceration records (if applicable and disclosed)
- Housing instability periods
- Previous social service engagement

**Red Flags**:
- Employment claims during documented incarceration
- Continuous employment during periods of documented homelessness without explanation
- Income claims inconsistent with assistance receipt
- Employer verification failures

### **Responsibility Assessment Components**

#### **Financial Responsibility Evaluation**
**Assessment Questions** (scored 1-5 scale):
1. "When you've had money, how have you typically prioritized spending?" (Housing, food, substance, entertainment evaluation)
2. "Describe a time when you had to choose between immediate wants and long-term needs"
3. "How do you plan to manage phone payments once employed?"
4. "What would you do if your phone was stolen or damaged?"
5. "How important is building credit and financial stability to your future goals?"

#### **Property Care Assessment**
**Evaluation Areas**:
- Previous experience with valuable items (phones, tools, vehicles)
- History of loss, theft, or damage to personal property
- Understanding of device replacement costs ($300+ value)
- Commitment to protective measures (cases, insurance, security)

#### **Reliability Indicators**
**Behavioral History Questions**:
- Appointment attendance patterns with service providers
- Previous employment punctuality and attendance
- Follow-through on commitments and obligations
- Response to authority and workplace supervision
- Conflict resolution and problem-solving approaches

### **Risk Factor Screening**

#### **High-Risk Indicators for Program Exclusion**
1. **Active Substance Abuse**: Current daily use affecting cognitive function or reliability
2. **Untreated Mental Health Crisis**: Acute symptoms requiring immediate clinical intervention
3. **Violent Behavior History**: Recent incidents involving physical aggression
4. **Property Destruction**: Pattern of damaging belongings or facilities
5. **Dishonesty in Assessment**: >20% response inconsistency rate
6. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Demands for high-wage employment without relevant experience
7. **Previous Program Abuse**: History of taking advantage of assistance programs without genuine participation

#### **Moderate-Risk Indicators Requiring Additional Support**
1. **Substance Use in Recovery**: Recent sobriety requiring enhanced support
2. **Learning Disabilities**: Need for modified training approaches
3. **Mental Health Management**: Stable conditions requiring workplace accommodations
4. **Limited Technology Experience**: Requiring extended training period
5. **Transportation Barriers**: Need for Trinity Trikes or public transit dependence

#### **Low-Risk Indicators for Program Success**
1. **Previous Stable Employment**: Even if interrupted by homelessness
2. **Demonstrated Responsibility**: History of meeting obligations despite challenges
3. **Recovery Progress**: Stable substance abuse recovery (>90 days)
4. **Support System**: Family, friends, or service provider support network
