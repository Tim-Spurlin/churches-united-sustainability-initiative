# Technical Specs

This document describes the AI architecture and implementation details for the Resume Generator program.

## AI Architecture

The AI architecture for the Resume Generator program is based on a transformer model, which is a type of neural network architecture that has proven effective in natural language processing tasks. The transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, which are both made up of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The encoder processes the input resume data and the decoder generates the output resume text.

## Implementation Details

The Resume Generator program is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The transformer model is built using the Keras Functional API, which allows for flexible and modular model design. The self-attention mechanism is implemented using the MultiHeadAttention layer in Keras, and the feed-forward neural networks are implemented using the Dense layer.

The model is trained on a large dataset of resumes and job descriptions using supervised learning. The input to the model is a combination of the resume data and the job description, and the output is the generated resume text. The model is trained to minimize the difference between the generated resume text and the actual resume text in the training data.

During training, the model learns to identify patterns and relationships in the resume data and job descriptions, and to use this information to generate relevant and coherent resume text. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input data when generating each part of the resume, and the feed-forward neural networks allow for complex transformations of the input data.

Once trained, the model can be used to generate resumes for new job descriptions by providing the job description as input and sampling from the model's output distribution. The generated resumes can then be further edited and customized by the user.
