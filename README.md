Since Trinity Trikes operates under Minnesota's electric-assist cycle classification (Statute 169.011), riders do not need a driver's license—a critical advantage for homeless individuals who often lack identification documents or have suspended licenses

- **Integrated Mental Health & Substance Recovery**: Comprehensive approaches that address the interconnection between mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and homelessness

- **Neurodevelopmental Awareness & Support**: Programs specifically addressing the needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and other conditions that are frequently undiagnosed or undertreated among homeless populations

- **Comprehensive Staff Training**: Equipping staff across all Churches United facilities (Micah's Mission, Dorothy Day House, Dorothy Day Food Pantry, Bright Sky Apartments, and Silver Linings Apartments) with specialized training in recognizing and appropriately responding to diverse conditions

- **Chemical Imbalance Education & Treatment Pathways**: Educational initiatives helping individuals understand how neurotransmitter imbalances (affecting dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate) can drive behavior and self-medication, connecting this understanding to appropriate treatment options

These initiatives recognize that many individuals experiencing homelessness are attempting to address untreated conditions through self-medication, often unaware that their struggles stem from treatable neurobiological differences. By providing both education and appropriate support pathways, these programs aim to revolutionize how we understand and address the complex interplay between neurodevelopmental conditions, mental health, substance use, and homelessness.

The ultimate goal is transformation through understanding—helping individuals gain insight into their own neurological makeup, access appropriate support, and develop sustainable pathways to stability and self-sufficiency across all Churches United facilities.
